Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe the magic bits
                that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

                Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
                perf_event_attr.config. Supported attribute are listed
                below::

				event  = "config:0-7"  - event ID
