      A list of the connections between audio components. Each entry is a
      pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink, the second
      being the connection's source.

    description: |
      A list of DAPM endpoints which mark paths between these endpoints should
      not be disabled when system enters in suspend state. LPA means low power
      audio case. For example on asymmetric multiprocessor, there are Cortex-A
      core and Cortex-M core, Linux is running on Cortex-A core, RTOS or other
      OS is running on Cortex-M core. The audio hardware devices can be
      controlled by Cortex-M. LPA can be explained as a mechanism that Cortex-A
      allocates a large buffer and fill audio data, then Cortex-A can enter
      into suspend for the purpose of power saving. Cortex-M continues to play
      the sound during suspend phase of Cortex-A. LPA requires some audio paths
      still enabled when Cortex-A enters into suspend.
